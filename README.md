# PubMed-FiledScanner

This program starts from a given article, makes a bredth-first-search for your given depth and collects the top articles which are returned from Pubmed which are sorted by the 
amount of edges between all found articles. Further supports an export to csv from nodes and edges for e.g. gephi graph visualisation tool.

You just need to download this script, replace in the 4th line the "" with your mail and run it via python topArticlesInField.py 'pubmed-id'.
